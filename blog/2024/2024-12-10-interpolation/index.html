A critical question is to understand the impact of using different interpolation processes. This blog introduces the equivalent relationships between rectified flows induced by these different interpolation processes, as discussed in Chapter 3 of these <a href="https://github.com/lqiang67/rectified-flow/tree/main/pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">lecture notes</a>. Related observations and discussions can also be found in <d-cite key="karras2022elucidating,kingma2024understanding,shaulbespoke,gao2025diffusionmeetsflow"></d-cite>.</p> <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2> <p>Given a coupling \((X_0, X_1)\) of source distribution \(X_0\sim \pi_0\) and target unknown data distribution \(X_1 \sim \pi_1\), recall that rectified flow learns an ODE</p> \[\mathrm d Z_t = v_t(Z_t) \mathrm d t,\] <p>which, starts from the noise \(Z_0=X_0\), ends at generated data \(Z_1\). This velocity field \(v_t\) is learned by minimizing the mean square error from the slope of an interpolation process:</p> \[\min_v \int _0 ^1 \mathbb E \left[\left\| \dot X_t - v_t(X_t)\right\|^2 \right] \mathrm d t,\] <p>where \(\{X_t\} = \{X_t: t\in [0,1]\}\) is the interpolation process connecting \(X_0\) and \(X_1\), and \(\dot X_t\) denotes its time derivative. We call the ODE process \(\mathrm d Z_t = v_t(Z_t) \mathrm d t\) with \(Z_0=X_0\) the rectified flow induced from \(\{X_t\}\), and denote it as:</p> \[\{Z_t\} = \texttt {Rectify}(\{X_t\}),~~~~~~~~(Z_0,Z_1)= \texttt{RectifiedCoupling}(\{X_t\}),\] <p>where the noise-data pair \((Z_0,Z_1)\) generated by RF is called the rectified coupling of \(\{X_t\}\).</p> <p>In principle, any time-differentiable interpolation process, \(\{X_t\}\), connecting \(X_0\) and \(X_1\) can be used within this framework. Different existing methods employ various interpolation schemes. The simplest choice is straight interpolation, defined as \(X_t = t X_1 + (1-t) X_0\), which is also well-justified by optimal transport theory. However, other methods, such as DDIM and DDPM, use curved interpolation schemes of a more general affine form, \(X_t = \alpha_t X_1 + \beta_t X_0\), where \(\alpha_t\) and \(\beta_t\) are chosen differently.</p> <p>What is the impact of the choice of interpolation? Do different interpolation schemes yield fundamentally different rectified flow dynamics? At first glance, one might suspect that these choices, by influencing the learned rectified flow, could significantly affect inference performance and speed. This would imply that the interpolation scheme must be determined during training. It turns out this is not necessarily the case.</p> <p>In this blog, we demonstrate that if two interpolation processes are <em>pointwise transformable</em> (or <em>topologically equivalent</em>) in an appropriate sense, their rectified flows can also be pointwise transformed using the same maps, resulting in identical rectified couplings. Notably, any two affine interpolations are pointwise transformable, which indicates that it is essentially sufficient to focus on the simplest straight-line interpolation. Specifically, the use of different affine interpolations, and all other interpolations that are topologically equivalent to straight-line interpolations, can be addressed by employing straight-line interpolations, but with adjusted training losses and discretization algorithms. In particular, we show that using different affine interpolations is mathematically equivalent to incorporating time-weighting into the training loss. Further implications for discretization algorithms are discussed in this <a href="https://rectifiedflow.github.io/blog/2024/discretization/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p> <h2 id="point-wisely-transformable-interpolations">Point-wisely Transformable Interpolations</h2> <p>We first define what we mean by pointwise transformability between two processes.</p> <blockquote class="definition"> <p><strong>Definition 1.</strong> Let \(\{X_t : t \in [0,1]\}\) and \(\{X'_t : t \in [0,1]\}\) be two interpolations.
