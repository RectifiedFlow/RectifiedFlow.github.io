Most diffusion and flow models can be analyzed through the rectified flow lens, but they employ different interpolation methods, typically affine interpolations such as straight-line or spherical interpolations. A critical question is to understand the impact of using different interpolation processes. This blog introduces the equivalent relationships between rectified flows induced by these different interpolation processes, as discussed in Chapter 3 of these [lecture notes](https://github.com/lqiang67/rectified-flow/tree/main/pdf). Related observations and discussions can also be found in <d-cite key="karras2022elucidating,kingma2024understanding,shaulbespoke,gao2025diffusionmeetsflow"></d-cite>.


## Overview

Given a coupling $$(X_0, X_1)$$ of source distribution $$X_0\sim \pi_0$$ and target unknown data distribution $$X_1 \sim \pi_1$$, recall that rectified flow learns an ODE

$$
\mathrm d Z_t = v_t(Z_t) \mathrm d t,
$$

which, starts from the noise $$Z_0=X_0$$, ends at generated data $$Z_1$$. This velocity field $$v_t$$ is learned by minimizing the mean square error from the slope of an interpolation process:

$$
\min_v \int _0 ^1 \mathbb E \left[\left\| \dot X_t - v_t(X_t)\right\|^2 
\right] \mathrm d t,
$$

where $$\{X_t\} = \{X_t: t\in [0,1]\}$$ is the interpolation process connecting $$X_0$$ and $$X_1$$, and $$\dot X_t$$ denotes its time derivative. We call the ODE process $$\mathrm d Z_t = v_t(Z_t) \mathrm d t$$ with $$Z_0=X_0$$ the rectified flow induced from $$\{X_t\}$$, and denote it as:

$$
\{Z_t\} = \texttt {Rectify}(\{X_t\}),~~~~~~~~(Z_0,Z_1)= \texttt{RectifiedCoupling}(\{X_t\}), 
$$

where the noise-data pair $$(Z_0,Z_1)$$ generated by RF is called the rectified coupling of $$\{X_t\}$$. 

In principle, any time-differentiable interpolation process, $$\{X_t\}$$, connecting $$X_0$$ and $$X_1$$ can be used within this framework. Different existing methods employ various interpolation schemes. The simplest choice is straight interpolation, defined as $$X_t = t X_1 + (1-t) X_0$$, which is also well-justified by optimal transport theory. However, other methods, such as DDIM and DDPM, use curved interpolation schemes of a more general affine form, $$X_t = \alpha_t X_1 + \beta_t X_0$$, where $$\alpha_t$$ and $$\beta_t$$ are chosen differently.

What is the impact of the choice of interpolation? Do different interpolation schemes yield fundamentally different rectified flow dynamics? At first glance, one might suspect that these choices, by influencing the learned rectified flow, could significantly affect inference performance and speed. This would imply that the interpolation scheme must be determined during training. It turns out this is not necessarily the case.

In this blog, we demonstrate that if two interpolation processes are *pointwise transformable* (or *topologically equivalent*) in an appropriate sense, their rectified flows can also be pointwise transformed using the same maps, resulting in identical rectified couplings. Notably, any two affine interpolations are pointwise transformable, which indicates that it is essentially sufficient to focus on the simplest straight-line interpolation. Specifically, the use of different affine interpolations, and all other interpolations that are topologically equivalent to straight-line interpolations, can be addressed by employing straight-line interpolations, but with adjusted training losses and discretization algorithms. In particular, we show that using different affine interpolations is mathematically equivalent to incorporating time-weighting into the training loss. Further implications for discretization algorithms are discussed in this [blog](https://rectifiedflow.github.io/blog/2024/discretization/).


## Point-wisely Transformable Interpolations

We first define what we mean by pointwise transformability.

> **Definition 1.** Let $$\{X_t : t \in [0,1]\}$$ and $$\{X'_t : t \in [0,1]\}$$ be two interpolations. They are **pointwise transformable** if there exist differentiable maps $$\tau: [0,1] \to [0,1]$$ and $$\phi: [0,1] \times \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d$$ such that $$\phi_t$$ is invertible for each $$t \in [0,1],$$ and 
> 
> $$
> X'_t = \phi_t(X_{\tau_t}), \quad  \forall t \in [0,1].
> $$
{: .definition}

If two interpolations are pointwise transformable and contructed from the same coupling, their rectified flows are also related by the **same** transform, and they induce the same coupling.


> **Theorem 1.** Suppose $$\{X_t\}$$ and $$\{X'_t\}$$ are pointwise transformable and constructed from the same coupling $$(X_0, X_1) = (X'_0, X'_1)$$. Assume $$\tau_0=0$$ and $$\tau_1=1$$. 
>
> Let $$\{v_t\}$$ and $$\{v'_t\}$$ be the corresponding rectified flow velocity fields, and let $$\{Z_t\}$$ and $$\{Z'_t\}$$ their rectified flows with $$\mathrm d Z_t = v_t(Z_t)\mathrm d t,Z_0 = X_0$$ and $$\mathrm d Z'_t = v'_t(Z'_t)\mathrm d t, Z'_0=X'_0.$$ Then:
> 
> 1. $$\{Z_t\},\{Z'_t\}$$ can be transformed with the same pointwise maps:
> 
>    $$
>    Z'_t = \phi_t(Z_{\tau_t}) \quad \text{for all } t \in [0,1].
>    $$
>
> 3. The rectified couplings match:
> 
>    $$
>    (Z_0, Z_1) = (Z'_0, Z'_1).
>    $$
>
> 4. The velocity fields satisfy:
> 
>    $$
>    v'_t(x) = \partial_t \phi_t(\phi_t^{-1}(x)) + \bigl(\nabla \phi_t(\phi_t^{-1}(x))\bigr)^\top v_{\tau_t}(\phi_t^{-1}(x)) \dot{\tau}_t. \tag{1}
>    $$
{: .theorem}

Thus, for a pointwise transform $$\texttt{Transform},$$

$$
\texttt{Rectify}(\texttt{Transform}(\{X_t\})) = \texttt{Transform}(\texttt{Rectify}(\{X_t\})).
$$

###  Affine Interpolations are Pointwise Transformable

Many commonly used interpolation schemes are affine, they can be expressed as:

$$
X_t = \alpha_t X_1 + \beta_t X_0,
$$

with $$\alpha_t$$ and $$\beta_t$$ are monotone, $$\alpha_0=\beta_1=0,$$ and $$\alpha_1 = \beta_0 = 1.$$

Some examples of affine interpolations:

1. ***Straight interpolation*** <d-cite key="liu2022flow,lipman2022flow,albergo2023stochastic"></d-cite>:

   $$
   X_t = tX_1 + (1-t) X_0.
   $$
   
   This yields straight lines connecting $$\pi_0$$ and $$\pi_1$$ at a constant speed $$\dot X_t = X_1 - X_0.$$
   
2. ***Spherical linear interpolation***  (*slerp*) <d-cite key="nichol2021improved"></d-cite>: 

   $$
   X_t = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} t\right)X_1  +   \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} t\right)X_0,
   $$
   
   which travels along the shortest great-circle arc on a sphere at a constant speed.
   
3. ***DDIM interpolation*** <d-cite key="song2020denoising"></d-cite> a spherical interpolation satisfying $$\alpha_t^2 + \beta_t^2 = 1$$ but with a non-uniform speed defined by $\alpha_t$:

   $$
   X_t = \alpha_t X_1 + \sqrt{1-\alpha_t^2} X_0,
   $$
   

where $$\alpha_t = \exp\bigl(-\frac{1}{4}a(1-t)^2 - \tfrac{1}{2}b(1-t)\bigr)$$, and $$a=19.9,b=0.1$$ by default.

For affine interpolations, the maps $$\phi$$ and $$\tau$$ reduce to scalar transforms: **All affine interpolations are pointwise transformable by adjusting time and scaling**. Hence, their induced rectified flows and couplings are equivalent. This result aligns with observations made by other authors<d-cite key="karras2022elucidating,kingma2024understanding,shaulbespoke,gao2025diffusionmeetsflow"></d-cite>. 

> **Proposition 1. Conversion of Affine Interpolations**
>
> Let $$X_t = \alpha_t X_1 + \beta_t X_0$$ and $$X_t' = \alpha_t' X_1 + \beta_t' X_0$$ be two affine interpolations from the same coupling $$(X_0, X_1).$$ Then there exist scalar functions $$\tau_t$$ and $$\omega_t$$ such that
> $$
> X_t' = \frac{1}{\omega_t} X_{\tau_t}, \quad \forall t \in [0,1],
> $$
>
> where $$\tau_t$$ and $$\omega_t$$ solve
>
> $$
> \frac{\alpha_{\tau_t}}{\beta_{\tau_t}} = \frac{\alpha'_t}{\beta'_t}, \quad \omega_t = \frac{\alpha_{\tau_t}}{\alpha'_t} = \frac{\beta_{\tau_t}}{\beta'_t}, \quad \forall t \in (0, 1) \tag{2}
> $$
>
> with the boundary conditions $$\omega_0 = \omega_1 = 1,  \tau_0 = 0,  \tau_1 = 1.$$
{: .definition}

In practice, we can determine $$\tau_t$$ numerically—e.g., via a [binary search](https://github.com/lqiang67/rectified-flow/blob/main/rectified_flow/flow_components/interpolation_convertor.py)—or derive an analytic solution in certain simple cases.

</div>

In theory, different affine interpolations induce equivalent continuous-time rectified flows. However, when we numerically solve ODEs, different interpolation schemes produce different discretization errors. Straighter trajectories generally yield smaller errors and more accurate final results.

Fortunately, because we can convert between affine interpolation schemes without retraining, we can choose a scheme at inference time that yields "straighter" trajectories $$\{Z_t\}$$, thus improving sampling performance.

## Implications on Loss Functions

Suppose we have trained a parametric model $$v_t(x;\theta)$$ to approximate the RF velocity field $$v_t(x)$$ under a particular affine interpolation. After training, we can use the relationships derived above to convert this model into $$v'_t(x;\theta)$$, corresponding to a different affine interpolation, without retraining.

This leads to two related questions:  

1. How does training with one interpolation differ from training directly with another?  
2. Does converting a pretrained model $$v_t$$ to $$v'_t$$ degrade performance?

It turns out that choosing a different affine interpolation during training is equivalent to changing the **time-weighting** in the loss function and applying an affine transform to the model parameterization. As long as the transformations $$\omega_t$$ and $$\tau_t$$ are not highly singular, converting a model from one affine interpolation to another does not inherently reduce performance.

Specifically, consider a model $$v_t(x; \theta)$$ trained to approximate the RF velocity $$v_t$$ of interpolation $$X_t = \alpha_t X_1 + \beta_t X_0$$:

$$
\mathcal L(\theta) = \int_0^1 \mathbb E\left[
\eta_t \left \| \dot X_t - v_t(X_t;\theta)\right\|^2
\right] \mathrm dt. \tag{4}
$$

After training, we can convert this model $$v_t(x; \theta)$$ into an approximation of $$v'_t$$ of a different interpolation $$X'_t = \alpha_t' X_1 + \beta_t' X_0$$ via:

$$
v'_t(x; \theta) = \frac{\dot{\tau}_t}{\omega_t} v_{\tau_t}(\omega_t x; \theta) - \frac{\dot{\omega}_t}{\omega_t} x.
$$

On the other hand, if we were to train $$v'_t(x; \theta)$$ directly to approximate the velocity $$v'_t$$ of interpolation $$X'_t = \alpha'_t X_1 + \beta'_t X_0$$, the loss function is:

$$
\mathcal L'(\theta) = \int_0^1 \mathbb{E} \left[ \eta'_t \left\| \dot{X}'_t - v'_t(X'_t; \theta) \right\|^2 \right] \mathrm dt \tag{5}
$$

Matching the loss $$(4)$$ and $$(5)$$, shows that the two training schemes differ only in time-weighting and parameterization. Specifically,

$$
\eta'_t = \frac{\omega_t^2}{\dot{\tau}_t} \eta_{\tau_t},
\quad
v'_t(x; \theta) = \frac{\dot{\tau}_t}{\omega_t} v_{\tau_t}(\omega_t x; \theta) - \frac{\dot{\omega}_t}{\omega_t} x. \tag{6}
$$

In other words, **training under different affine interpolation schemes is equivalent to applying a different time-weighting function and a corresponding model reparameterization.**

### Straight vs. Spherical: Identical Train Time Weight

Following Example 2, an interesting case arises when $$\dot{\alpha}'_t \beta'_t - \alpha'_t \dot{\beta}'_t$$ is a constant. In this case, $$\eta'_t$$ is proportional to $$\eta_{\tau_t}$$. If $$\eta_t = 1$$ is uniform, then $$\eta'_t$$ also remains uniform, meaning the two interpolation schemes share the same loss function.

> **Example 3. Losses for Straight vs. Spherical Interpolation**
> 
> Consider the spherical interpolation:
> $$
> X'_t = \sin\left(\frac{\pi t}{2}\right)X_1 + \cos\left(\frac{\pi t}{2}\right)X_0.
> $$
>
> For this choice, $$\dot{\alpha}'_t \beta'_t - \alpha'_t \dot{\beta}'_t = \frac{\pi}{2}$$. Hence:
>
> $$
> \eta'_t = \frac{2}{\pi}\eta_{\tau_t}, \quad \tau_t = \frac{\tan\left(\frac{\pi t}{2}\right)}{\tan\left(\frac{\pi t}{2}\right)+1}.
> $$
>
> Thus, training $$v_t$$ for the straight interpolation with a uniform weight ($$\eta_t=1$$) is equivalent to training $$v'_t$$ for the spherical interpolation with a uniform weight ($$\eta'_t=2/\pi$$). The only difference is a reparameterization of the model:
>
> $$
> v'_t(x, \theta) = \frac{\pi \omega_t}{2} \left( v_{\tau_t}(\omega_t x; \theta) + \left( \cos\left(\frac{\pi t}{2}\right) - \sin\left(\frac{\pi t}{2}\right) \right) x \right),
> $$
>
> where $$\omega_t = (\sin(\frac{\pi t}{2}) + \cos(\frac{\pi t}{2}))^{-1}$$ is bounded within $$[1/\sqrt{2}, 1]$$. 
{: .example}

This reparameterization does not significantly affect performance. In the following figures, we show that choosing between straight or spherical interpolation makes **little difference** in training outcomes.

      Comparing two RF models: one trained with straight interpolation and another trained with spherical interpolation, both uniform loss weight.

The results show only minor discrepancies, confirming that the reparameterization’s impact on performance is limited.
