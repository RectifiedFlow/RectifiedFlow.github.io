## Overview
Rectified flow yields an ordinary differential equation (ODE), also known as a flow model, of the form $$\mathrm d Z_t = v_t(Z_t)\mathrm d t$$, which generates the data $$Z_1$$ starting from an initial noise $$Z_0$$. This approach offers a simplification compared to diffusion models, such as DDPM and score-based models, which rely on a stochastic differential equation (SDE) to generate data from noise.

However, the boundary between flow and diffusion models has been known to be blurry since the work of DDIM and probability-flow ODEs, which show that it is possible to convert between SDEs and ODEs during the post-training phase, without requiring re-training of the model. Historically, SDE-based models were introduced first, followed by the derivation of simpler ODE-based counterparts. Now taking the ODE models, it is also possible to  convert an ODE back to get SDE models. Several questions arises:  

1. Why and how is it possible to convert between SDEs and ODEs?

2. Why add diffusion noise to an ODE, and what are the pros and cons?

We will explore these questions in this blog. For a more detailed discussion, see Chapter 5 of the [Rectified Flow Lecture Notes](https://github.com/lqiang67/rectified-flow/tree/main/pdf). Related works include DDIM, score-based SDEs, EDM. 

## Stochastic Samplers = RF + Langevin

Given a coupling $$(X_0, X_1)$$ of noise and data points, rectified flow defines an interpolation process, such as $$X_t = t X_1 + (1 - t) X_0$$, and "rectifies" or "causalizes" it to yield an ODE model $$\mathrm{d} Z_t = v_t(Z_t) \, \mathrm{d} t$$ initialized from $$Z_0 = X_0.$$ 
The velocity field is given by $$v_t(z) = \mathbb{E}[\dot{X}_t \mid X_t = z],$$ which is estimated by minimizing the loss $$\mathbb{E}_{t, X_0, X_1} \left[ \left\| \dot{X}_t - v_t(X_t) \right\|^2 \right].$$

The idea is that, by the construction of the velocity field $$v_t$$, the distribution of $$Z_t$$ on the ODE trajectory matches the distribution of $$X_t$$ on the interpolation path at each time $$t$$. As a result, the final output $$Z_1$$ of the ODE follows the same distribution as $$X_1$$, the target data distribution. This follows an inductive principle: if the distributions of $$X_t$$ and $$Z_t$$ match up to a given time, the construction of $$v_t$$ ensures they will continue to match at the next (infinitesimal) step. By being "scheduled to do the right thing at the right time," the process guarantees the correct final result.

An obvious problem of this is that, in practice, errors can accumulate over time as we solve the ODE $$\mathrm{d} Z_t = v_t(Z_t) \mathrm{d} t$$. These errors arise from model approximations and numerical discretization, causing drift between the estimated distribution and the true distribution. The issue can compound: if the estimated trajectory $$\hat{Z}_t$$ deviates significantly from the distribution of $$X_t$$, the update direction $$v_t(\hat{Z}_t)$$ becomes less accurate. This happens because fewer data points are sampled in low-probability regions during training, where model inaccuracies are more pronounced.

To address this problem, we may introduce a feedback mechanism to correct the error. One such approach is to use Langevin dynamics. 

Let $$\rho_t$$ be the density function of $$X_t$$, representing the true distribution that we aim to follow at time $$t$$. At each time step $$t$$, we can in principle apply a short segment of Langevin dynamics to adjust the trajectory's distribution toward $$\rho_t$$:

$$
\mathrm{d} Z_{t, \tau} = \sigma_t^2 \nabla \log \rho_t(Z_{t, \tau}) \, \mathrm{d} \tau + \sqrt{2} \, \sigma_t \, \mathrm{d} W_\tau, \quad \tau \geq 0,
$$

where $$\tau$$ is a new time scale introduced for the Langevin dynamics, $$\sigma_t$$ controls the noise level, and $$\nabla \log \rho_t$$ adjusts the drift to steer the distribution toward high-probability regions of $$\rho_t$$. It is well known that Langevin dynamics converge to the target distribution as $$\tau \to \infty$$.

Fully simulating Langevin dynamics would require a double-loop algorithm, where the system must be simulated to equilibrium ($$\tau\to\infty$$) at each time $$t$$ before moving to the next time point.  

In rectified flow, however, the trajectory is already close to $$\rho_t$$ at each time step $$t$$. Therefore, a single step of Langevin dynamics can be sufficient to reduce the drift. This allows us to directly integrate Langevin corrections into the rectified flow updates, yielding a combined stochastic differential equation (SDE):

$$
\mathrm{d}\tilde{Z}_t = \underbrace{v_t(\tilde{Z}_t) \mathrm{d} t}_{\text{Rectified Flow}} + \underbrace{\sigma_t^2 \nabla \log \rho_t(\tilde{Z}_t) \mathrm{d} t + \sqrt{2} \sigma_t \mathrm{d}W_t}_{\text{Langevin Dynamics}}, \quad \tilde{Z}_0 = Z_0. 
$$

This combined SDE achieves two key objectives:

1. The **rectified flow** drives the generative process forward as intended.

2. The **Langevin component** acts as a negative feedback loop, correcting distributional drift without bias when $$\tilde{Z}_t$$ and $$\rho_t$$ are well aligned.

When the simulation is accurate, Langevin dynamics naturally remain in equilibrium, avoiding unnecessary changes to the distribution. However, if deviations occur, this mechanism guides the estimate back on track, enhancing the robustness of the inference process.

The figure below illustrates the score function $$\nabla \log \rho_t$$ along the SDE trajectories. We can see that $$\nabla \log \rho_t$$ points toward high-density regions, nad hence can guid trajectories back to areas of higher probability whenever deviations occur.

## SDEs with Closed Form Score Functions

In general, it may be necessary to estimate the score function $$\nabla \log \rho_t$$ in addition to the RF velocity $$v_t$$. However, in certain special cases, the score function can be estimated using $$v_t$$, thereby eliminating the need to retrain an additional model. This approach enables a training-free conversion between ODEs and SDEs.

Specifically, if the rectified flow is induced by an affine interpolation $$X_t = \alpha_t X_1 + \beta_t X_0$$, where $$X_0$$ and $$X_1$$ are independent (i.e., $$X_0 \perp\!\!\!\perp X_1$$) and $$X_0$$ follows a standard Gaussian distribution, then by Tweedie's formula, we have 

$$
\nabla \log \rho_t(x) = -\frac{1}{\beta_t} \mathbb{E}[X_0 \mid X_t = x].
$$

On the other hand, the RF velocity is given by 

$$
v_t(x) = \mathbb{E}[\dot{X}_t \mid X_t = x] = \mathbb{E}[\dot{\alpha}_t X_1 + \dot{\beta}_t X_0 \mid X_t = x],
$$ 

where $$X_t = \alpha_t X_1 + \beta_t X_0$$. 

Using this, we can express $$\mathbb{E}[X_0 \mid X_t = x]$$ in terms of $$v_t(x)$$ and obtain 

$$
\nabla \log \rho_t(x) = \frac{1}{\lambda_t \beta_t} \left( \alpha_t v_t(x) - \dot{\alpha}_t x \right),
$$ 

where $$\lambda_t = \dot{\alpha}_t \beta_t - \alpha_t \dot{\beta}_t$$. 

As a result, the SDE takes the form 

$$
\mathrm d Z_t = v_t(Z_t)\mathrm d t +  \gamma (\alpha_t v_t (x) - \dot \alpha_t x) \mathrm{d} t +  \sqrt{2 \lambda_t \beta_t \gamma_t} \mathrm{d} W_t, 
$$

where we set $$\sigma_t^2 = \lambda_t \beta_t \gamma_t$$. 

This formulation recovers both the SDE of DDPM and the score-based SDEs when $$\gamma_t = 1 / \alpha_t$$ and $$\alpha^2_t + \beta_t^2 = 1$$, yielding 

$$
\mathrm{d} Z_t = 2 v_t(Z_t) \, \mathrm{d} t - \frac{\dot{\alpha}_t}{\alpha_t} Z_t \, \mathrm{d} t + \sqrt{2  \frac{\dot \alpha_t}{\alpha_t}} \mathrm{d} W_t.
$$
