### Stochastic Solvers: Guardrails for Generative Models

In this blog, we will elaborate on, given a pretrained flow model, how does a stochastic sampler (like DDPM) relate to a deterministic sampler as conducting simple Euler steps in rectified flow. In particular, we will show that one can convert any deterministic sampler to its corresponding stochastic counterparts, and vice versa. The main difference is that the stochastic sampler has an extra Langevin dynamics term, which could potentially help correct the discretization error from cumulative Euler steps. For a more comprehensive and rigorous discussion on this topic, please refer to Chapter 5 in the [Rectified Flow book]().

For an introduction to rectified flow and its foundational concepts, check out our earlier post [here](https://rectifiedflow.github.io/blog/2024/intro/)<d-cite key="Liu2022FlowSA"></d-cite>

When working with generative models, particularly those using rectified flow, errors can accumulate over time as we solve the ODE $dZ_t = v_t(Z_t) dt$. These errors arise from model approximations and numerical discretization, leading to drift between the estimated distribution $\hat{Z}_t$ and the true distribution $\rho_t$. Here, $\rho_t$ represents the smooth density function of the true distribution $X_t$. This problem is exacerbated in low-density regions rarely sampled during training, where model inaccuracies are more pronounced.

To address this, **stochastic solvers** can replace deterministic ODE solvers during inference. By introducing stochastic dynamics, we can dynamically correct these errors, ensuring the estimated distribution stays aligned with the true one.

#### Langevin Dynamics as a Guardrail

One common and promising approach is to use **Langevin dynamics** as a corrective mechanism. At each timestep $t$, a short segment of Langevin dynamics is applied to adjust $\hat{Z}_t$ toward $\rho_t$:

$$
dZ_{t, \tau} = \sigma_t^2 \nabla \log \rho_t(Z_{t, \tau}) d\tau + \sqrt{2}\sigma_t dW_\tau, \quad \tau \geq 0
$$

Here, $\sigma_t$ controls the noise level, and $\nabla \log \rho_t$ adjusts the drift toward high-probability regions of $\rho_t$. While simulating Langevin dynamics until equilibrium would align the distribution perfectly, this is often unnecessary. A single step of Langevin dynamics can sufficiently reduce drift when $\hat{Z}_t$ is already close to $\rho_t$.

To streamline this process, Langevin corrections can be integrated directly into the rectified flow updates, resulting in a combined stochastic differential equation (SDE):

$$
d\tilde{Z}_t = \underbrace{v_t(\tilde{Z}_t) dt}_{\text{Rectified Flow}} + \underbrace{\sigma_t^2 \nabla \log \rho_t(\tilde{Z}_t) dt + \sqrt{2} \sigma_t dW_t}_{\text{Langevin Dynamics}}, \quad \tilde{Z}_0 = Z_0
$$

This combined SDE achieves two goals:

1. The **rectified flow** drives the generative process forward as intended.
2. The **Langevin component** acts as a negative feedback loop, correcting distributional drift without bias when $\tilde{Z}_t$ and $\rho_t$ are already well aligned.

#### Why It Works

If the simulation is accurate, Langevin dynamics naturally stay in equilibrium, meaning they won’t alter the distribution unnecessarily. But when deviations occur, this mechanism gently nudges the estimate back on track, providing robustness to the inference process.

By incorporating stochastic solvers like these, we create a dynamic correction framework that enhances the stability and accuracy of generative models, ensuring that outputs remain high-quality and faithful to the intended distributions.

**Score Function Visualization:**
In the next toy example, we’ll visualize the score function $\nabla \log \rho_t$. This will help you see how these small corrective forces guide the samples toward the right regions, improving upon what a purely deterministic approach can achieve.

</div>

As shown here, the score function ($\nabla \log \rho_t$) points samples toward regions of higher density. This corrects the trajectories from the original predicted velocity, providing a drifting force that helps ensure samples converge to the most probable areas of the target distribution.

### SDEs with Gaussian Initial Distributions

Previously, we demonstrated that for a rectified flow using interpolation $X_t = \alpha_t X_1 + \beta_t X_0$, two processes can achieve the same target distribution $\pi_1$:

- **The ODE process:**

  $$d Z_t = v_t(Z_t)dt$$

- **The SDE process:**

  $$d Z_t = v_t(Z_t)dt + \sigma_t^2 \nabla \log \rho_t(Z_t) dt + \sqrt{2} \sigma_t d W_t,$$

The **Euler method** is commonly used to discretize the ODE process, yielding the following update rule:

$$
\hat{Z}_{t + \Delta t} = \hat{Z}_t + \Delta t \cdot v(\tilde{Z}_t)
$$

Similarly, the SDE process can be discretized. When introducing a noise level $\sigma_t$ at time $t$, the update step becomes:

$$
\hat{Z}_{t + \Delta t} = \hat{Z}_t + \Delta t \cdot (v(\hat{Z}_t) + \frac{\sigma_t^2}{\beta_t \lambda_t} (\alpha_t v(\hat{Z}_t) - \dot{\alpha}_t \hat{Z}_t))  + \sqrt{2}  \sigma_t \xi_t,
$$

Here:

- $\lambda_t = \dot{\alpha}_t \beta_t - \alpha_t \dot{\beta}_t$
- $\xi$ is random Gaussian noise sampled from $\mathcal{N}(0, I)$.

This update rule explicitly incorporates the Langevin dynamics term, derived in detail in Chapter 5.3 of the [Rectified Flow book](TBD: insert link).

In practice, the `AffineInterpSolver` in our [Rectified Flow repository](https://github.com/lqiang67/rectified-flow) provides an efficient way to compute the score function. This solver supports scenarios where at least two of the variables $(x_0, x_1, x_t, \dot{x}_t)$ are known, enabling the estimation of the others.
