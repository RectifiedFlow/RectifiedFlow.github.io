  <p>Rectified flow is a unified framework for generative modeling that offers a simplified view on flow- and diffusion-based techniques. It has been applied to state-of-the-art image, audio, and video generation.</p>

  <p>In a nutshell, rectified flow interpolates between noise and data distributions through an interpolation process. This process is then "rectified" (or "causalized") to produce a generative ODE model. The procedure can be repeated to "reflow" the system, yielding ODEs with straighter trajectories that can be discretized using fewer, or even a single, step.</p>

  <p>This series of tutorials on rectified flow addresses topics that are often sources of confusion and highlights the connections between rectified flow and other generative modeling methods.</p>

  <p>We provide a <a href="https://github.com/lqiang67/rectified-flow">codebase</a> and <a href="#">lecture notes</a> with detailed theoretical derivations.</p>

  <p>If you have questions regarding the blog posts, codebase, or notes, please feel free to reach out via this <a href="mailto:rectifiedflow@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
